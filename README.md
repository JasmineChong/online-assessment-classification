# online-assessment-classification

## About
This project addresses the lack of online assessment classification models based on personalisation that focuses on each learning style’s preferences. By utilising the VAK Learning Styles Model and machine learning algorithms, the project identifies preferred online assessment methods for each learning style. A web application, ’Assessifier’ is developed and deployed for users to determine their dominant learning style and suitable online assessment methods. The study provides insights into personalised online assessment, emphasising the importance of incorporating diverse learning styles in education.

For a more in-depth understanding of the project, you can read the report and presentation slides in the 'Documentation' folder.
